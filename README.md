# Android-Shopping-Application
This was a project completed over the course of 4 months in my software design course. It stimulates a shopping experience through an android application.

Some functionalities that this application includes:

  Admin user:

  - adding new items to the list of things that could be purchased

  - deleting existing items that are in the database

  - creating additional admin accounts

  Customer user:

  - creating an account to shop with

  - adding/removing items from a shopping cart

  - checking out and finalizing a purchase
